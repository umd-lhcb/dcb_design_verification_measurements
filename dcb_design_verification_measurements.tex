\section{Transient current}
We used a Gauss probe connected to an oscilloscope to measure current.
The probe was warped around the cable which was connected to the positive end of
the \SI{1.5}{\volt} PSU.

All the measurements below assume a conversion factor of \SI{1}{\ampere/\volt}.
DCB S/N pilot 007, 008 were used for measurements.

\section{Transient voltage}
\subsection{Transient voltage on \SI{1.5}{\volt}}
We used a differential probe to measure the \SI{1.5}{\volt} rail on the DCB
directly.
We found a particular pair of contact, and handheld the probe to do the
measurements.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
        {./res/voltage_transient/time_out.png}
    \caption[Voltage transient due to timeout]{
        We have enabled timeout on master GBTx, and it would kick in every 2
        seconds.
        Timeout would reset\protect\footnotemark the GBTx.
        Measured on 007.
    }
\end{figure}

\footnotetext{Not sure if it means that the FSM would go back to state 0. This
statement comes from GBTx expert Daniel Hernandez.}

\subsection{Transient voltage on data GBTxs}
The \texttt{TX\_RDY} signals for all data GBTxs were brought out to the FFC
breakout boards.
We plugged in 2 differential probes on 2 of the breakout boards, and measured
that signal for data GBTxs 5 and 6.
During the measurement, only these 2 data GBTxs were programmed, due to the fact
that DCB 007 cannot regain lock if all 6 data GBTxs were all programmed.
DCB S/N pilot 007, 008 were used.

For DCB 007, \texttt{TX\_RDY} was still almost always asserted even if the
\SI{2.5}{\volt} rail was turned off, and was reasserted every 2 seconds.

For DCB 008, if the \SI{2.5}{\volt} was turned off, \texttt{TX\_RDY} was never
asserted, until the connection was restored; if only unplugging the master's
fibers, its behavior was the same as that of DCB 007.

    }
\end{figure}


\section{Power-on reset voltage}
We used two probes, one probing the \SI{1.5}{\volt} rail voltage (Green), the
other probe the voltage of the \texttt{MC\_RESET\_B} pin.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.8\linewidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[boximg]
        \node [anchor=south west] (main) {

        };
        \begin{scope}[x=(main.south east),y=(main.north west)]

    \begin{tikzpicture}[boximg,red]
        \node (zoom1) {
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]
                {./res/power_on_reset/power_on_reset-zoom.jpg}
        };
        \draw (zoom1.south west) rectangle (zoom1.north east);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption[Power-on vs. reset]{
        Both channels have very similar time constant.
        Sorensen XT-76 was used to supply \SI{1.5}{\volt}.
        The green curve was measured on the PSU output.
        This might be the issue that causes unstable power-up.
        Measured on 012.
    }
\end{figure}

Later, we realized that the Rigol, which has a slightly faster time constant,
and can turn on all channels at once, can combine 2 channels so that it can
supply current up to \SI{6}{\ampere}. We changed to the oldest board, and redid
the measurement.

It is worth noting that prior to this measurement, we did not use differential
probes---this was probably a bad idea, and we switched to an oscilloscope with
differential probes to do the measurement this time.

        This suggests that DCB has a smaller intrinsic time constant.
        Rigol was used to supply \SI{1.5}{\volt}.
        The green curve was measured on the board.
        After the switch, this board has a higher success (being in state 5)
        rate of power-up.
        Measured on 008.
